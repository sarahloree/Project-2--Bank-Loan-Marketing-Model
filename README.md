This is the second project I completed as part of the Machine Learning Module from my post-graduate certification in AI/ Machine Learning from University of Texas' McCombs School of Business.

# Project-2--Bank-Loan-Marketing-Model
To identify bank customers with a high likelihood of purchasing a loan, you need to analyze the provided data to understand key customer attributes influencing loan acquisition. With this analysis, build a predictive model that captures patterns and customer characteristics, which will help the bank effectively target potential loan buyers, improving marketing efforts and increasing conversion rates.
